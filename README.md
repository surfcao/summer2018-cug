# Applied Spatiotemporal Data Mining

## Course description

With the continuing advances of geographic information science and geospatial
technologies, spatially referenced information have been easily and
increasingly available in the past decades and becoming important information
sources in scientific research and decision making processes. To effectively
take advantage of the rich collection of spatial (and temporal) data,
statistical analysis is often necessary, e.g., to extract implicit knowledge
such as spatial relations and patterns that are not explicit in the data.
Spatial data analysis distinguishes itself from classical data analysis in that
spatial analysis focuses on locations, areas, distances, relationships and
interactions of measurements that are usually referenced as points, lines, and
areal units in geographical spaces. In the past decades, a plethora of theory,
methods and tools of spatial analysis have been developed from different
perspectives, and converged as fruitful fields of geographic information
science (GIScience) and spatial statistics.

The purpose of this class is to present the commonly used methods and current
trends in spatial and spatiotemporal data analysis, and innovative applications
in relevant fields (e.g., environmental science and engineering, natural
resources management, ecology, public health, climate sciences, civil
engineering, and social sciences). In this class, we will review the basic
principles in spatiotemporal analysis and modeling, and discuss commonly used
methods and tools. Students are expected to actively participate in class
lecture, complete lab assignments, read assigned articles and develop a project
of their own choice or directly related to their thesis/dissertation topics.
The following topics will be covered in the class, but can be adjustable to
meet the students' interests:

-   Exploratory spatial data analysis 

-   Space-time geostatistics

-   Spatial point process and species distribution modeling

-   Spatiotemporal disease mapping

-   Time series map analysis and change detection

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites of this course includes an understanding of basic concepts
of spatial analysis and statistics,  which could be fulfilled with basic
statistics courses or graduate level of GIS course. Students from different
disciplines are welcome, please contact the instructor should there any
question about the prerequisites.

## Learning outcomes

After completing this course, the students of this class are expected to be
able to:

-  formulate real-world problems in the context of spatial and spatiotemporal
   analysis with a knowledge of basic concepts and principles in this field;

-  understand commonly used concepts and methods in statistical analysis of
   spatiotemporal data;

-  apply appropriate spatial and spatiotemporal analytical methods to solve the
   formulated problems, and be able to critically review alternative methods;

-  utilize programmable scientific computing tools (e.g., R) to make maps,
   solve spatial and spatiotemporal analysis problems, and evaluate and assess
   the results of alternative methods; 

## Readings

-   A reading list of articles will be provided. The following books will be
    frequently referred to for reading:
